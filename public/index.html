            <h4>Chess Experiment</h4>
            <p>
                You have been invited to take part in a cognitive study that is looking at the process of finding a
                chess move. Whether or not you take part is your choice. If you do not want to take part, you do not
                have to give a reason. If you do want to take part now but change your mind later, you can pull out of
                the study at any time.
            </p>
            <h5>Participant’s Rights</h5>
            <p>
                You are under no obligation to accept this invitation. If you decide to participate, you have the right
                to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>decline to answer any particular question</li>
                <li>withdraw from the study (up to 6 weeks from the date of your participation)</li>
                <li>ask any questions about the study at any time during participation</li>
                <li>provide information on the understanding that your name will not be used</li>
                <li>be given access to a summary of the project findings when it is concluded</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY?</h5>
            <p>
                The purpose of this study is to examine all the possible moves that can be made in a chess position.
                This study aims to build on cognitive skill studies that examine the thought process for finding a chess
                move.
            </p>
            <h5>WHAT WILL MY PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY INVOLVE?</h5>
            <p>
                You have been chosen to participate because you meet the criteria of the study. The criteria include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>chess players with a Fide rating above 2000 (experts) </li>
                <li>amateur chess players</li>
                <li>to be able to read and type in English</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The study will involve you selecting your best move from 12 given chess positions in three blocks of
                four chess positions using your computer mouse. You will have a maximum of <span
                    class="move-time-span">TO
                    FILL IN</span> to make your move
                in each position. Please do not google or use devices to help you to select your move as we are
                interested in all the possible moves that players might make in the position shown. Firstly, you will
                see a practice chess position. You can practice moving chess pieces using your computer mouse. You can
                practice as many times as you like. After you have practiced enough to be familiar with the chess set,
                you can then select the tab to take you to Block One.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allow at least <span class="task-time-span">TO FILL IN</span> to complete the tasks. You will be
                presented
                with the words “Block One” and
                you push the start button to begin. Once you push start, the first chess position with the same
                interface as the practice chess position will appear. Take note of the clock counting down as this is
                the time you have in which to make your move. The position is finished as soon as you have placed a
                chess piece on an empty square or captured a piece with your computer mouse. Then the next position will
                appear. Once you have made your last move in the final fourth position by placing a chess piece on an
                empty square or capturing a piece, you will then be asked to complete a brief questionnaire. Once you
                have pushed submit on your questionnaire, you will see the words “Block two” with a start button appear.
                Once again after pushing start, the first chess position with a clock counting down will appear, and the
                position will be completed once you made your move by releasing the chess piece with your computer mouse
                on an empty square or by capturing a piece. Then the next position will appear. Once again after
                completing the final fourth position in Block Two, you will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire.
                After completing this, Block Three will appear with a start button. Once you pushed start, the first
                chess position with a clock counting down will appear, and the position will be completed once you made
                your move by releasing the chess piece with your computer mouse on an empty square or by capturing a
                piece. The next position will appear after this. Once again after placing a chess piece on an empty
                square or capturing a piece to complete the final fourth position in Block Three, you will be asked to
                complete a brief questionnaire. Once this is submitted, you have successfully completed the study.

                may find that you can complete the move in less time. A timer will appear on the screen, displaying the

            <p>
                You have decided that you can allow <span class="move-time-span">TO FILL IN</span> for making a move in

                Do not do more or less analysis than you would in the above situation, i.e., don’t “show off” for the
                exercise. This is not a “play and win” problem. It is supposed to be an interesting position from a real
                game and so to look for a “winning” – as opposed to a “best” – move may be a futile effort.

                made. You can then practice again by selecting the practice tab or you can start the first chess
                position if you need no further practice. Note that once you release the piece on a free square or
                capture another piece, the move is final, and you move on to the next position.
