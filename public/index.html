            <h4>Chess Experiment</h4>
            <p>
                You have been invited to take part in a cognitive study that is looking at the process of finding a
                chess move. Whether or not you take part is your choice. If you do not want to take part, you do not
                have to give a reason. If you do want to take part now but change your mind later, you can pull out of
                the study at any time.
            </p>
            <h5>Participant's Rights</h5>
            <p>
                You are under no obligation to accept this invitation. If you decide to participate, you have the right
                to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>decline to answer any particular question</li>
                <li>withdraw from the study (up to 6 weeks from the date of your participation)</li>
                <li>ask any questions about the study at any time during participation</li>
                <li>provide information on the understanding that your name will not be used</li>
                <li>be given access to a summary of the project findings when it is concluded</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY?</h5>
            <p>
                The purpose of this study is to examine all the possible moves that can be made in a chess position.
                This study aims to build on cognitive skill studies that examine the thought process for finding a chess
                move.
            </p>
            <h5>WHAT WILL MY PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY INVOLVE?</h5>
            <p>
                You have been chosen to participate because you meet the criteria of the study. The criteria include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To be able to read and type in English.</li>
                <li>You have played 15 fully rated games.</li>
                <li>
                    Either:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You have a Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE) Rating of 1900 and above.</li>
                        <li>Or - a New Zealand Chess Federation (NZCF) rating of 1400 and under.</li>
                        <li>Or - you have prior approval from the researcher that your chess federation rating is the
                            equivalent of a NZCF rating of 1300 or under.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The study will involve you using your computer mouse to select the best move from the sequential
                presentation (one by one) of four chess positions.
                You will have a maximum of <span class="move-time-span">TO
                    FILL IN</span> to make your move
                in each position. Please do not google or use devices to help you to select your move as we are
                interested in all the possible moves that players might make in the position shown.
                Further, do not take screens shots of the chess positions to help you answer the questionnaires as we
                are only interested in your initial post move thoughts.Firstly, you will
                see a practice chess position. You can practice moving chess pieces using your computer mouse. You can
                practice as many times as you like. After you have practiced enough to be familiar with the chess set,
                you can then select the tab to take you to Position 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allow at least <span class="task-time-span">TO FILL IN</span> to complete the tasks.
                You will be presented with "Position 1" and you push the start button to begin.
                Once you push start, the first chess position with the same
                interface as the practice chess position will appear. Take note of the clock counting down as this is
                the time you have in which to make your move. The position is finished as soon as you have placed a
                chess piece on an empty square or captured a piece with your computer mouse. You will then be asked to
                complete a brief questionnaire.
                Once you have pushed submit on your questionnaire, you will see "Position 2" with a start button appear.
                Once again after pushing start, the second chess position
                with a clock counting down will appear, and the position will be completed once you made your move by
                releasing the chess piece with your computer mouse on an empty square or by capturing a piece. Once
                again you will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire. After completing this, “Position 3” will
                appear with a start button. Once you pushed start, the chess position with a clock counting down will
                appear, and the position will be completed once you made your move by releasing the chess piece with
                your computer mouse on an empty square or by capturing a piece. Once again you will be asked to complete
                a brief questionnaire. Once you have pushed "submit" on your questionnaire, you will see "Position 4"
                with a start button appear.
                As soon as you push start, the final (4th) chess position with
                a clock counting down will appear, and the position will be completed once you made your move by
                releasing the chess piece with your computer mouse on an empty square or by capturing a piece. Finally,
                you will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire. Once this is submitted, you have successfully
                completed the study.
