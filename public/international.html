                My name is Nicholas Barr and I have participated infrequently in chess tournaments around New Zealand
                and Australia. I also was in the past a member of the Launceston, Wellington and Manawatu chess clubs.
                I'm currently doing a Master of Science (Psychology) with Massey University.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would like to invite chess club participants to take part in an online cognitive study that is looking
                at the process of finding a chess move. Participants must be over 16 years of age and be able to read
                and type in English. Currently, I require participants that have played 15 fully rated games, and who
                either have a FIDE rating of 1900 and above or a National Chess Federation rating of 1400 and under.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of this study is to examine all the possible moves that can be made in a chess position.
                This study aims to build on cognitive skill studies that examine the thought process for finding a chess
                move. Direct benefits of participating in this study include an increased awareness and knowledge of the
                processes involved in research by actively participating in it and a satisfaction in knowing that they
                are contributing to cognitive skill studies and chess. Foreseeable risks, adverse effects, and
                discomforts that one may encounter by taking part in this study are minimal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The time to complete this study will vary between approximately 20-40 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Participants have a right to access the information collected about them as part of this study. It is
                important to us that we maintain privacy throughout this study. The names and contact information will
                be held electronically and stored on the principal investigator's computer only for data recording
                purposes. Each participant in the study will be allocated a number. Staff involved in analysis will have
                access to participants' numbers only. All data from test sessions will be recorded against the
                participant's ID number and their name will never be used in any report, correspondence or publication.
