                My name is Nicholas Barr and I have participated infrequently in chess tournaments around New Zealand
                and Australia. An online chess study is part of my Master of Science degree at Massey University,
                Palmerston North, New Zealand. My supervisor is Dr Stephen Hill <a

                I would like to invite chess club participants to take part in an online chess study that is looking at
                the process of finding a chess move. Participants must be over 16 years of age and be able to read and
                type in English. Currently, I require participants that have played 15 fully rated games, and who either
                have a FIDE rating of 1900 and above or a National Chess Federation rating of 1400 and under. Please do
                email any further rating questions to <a href="mailto:herrbarr@yahoo.com">herrbarr@yahoo.com</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of this study is to examine all the possible moves that can be made in a chess position.
                This study aims to build on cognitive skill studies that examine the thought process for finding a chess
                move. Direct benefits of participating in this study include an increased awareness and knowledge of the
                processes involved in research by actively participating in it and a satisfaction in knowing that you
                are contributing to cognitive skill studies and chess. Foreseeable risks, adverse effects, and
                discomforts that may be encountered by taking part in this study are minimal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The time to complete this study will vary between approximately 20-40 minutes. In recognition of the
                time and participation in this study, participants will be given a Giftpay voucher worth NZ $15.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a Participant you have the right to access the information collected about you as part of this study.
                It is important to us that we maintain privacy throughout this study. The names and contact information
                will be held electronically and stored on the principal investigator's computer only for data recording
                purposes. Each participant in the study will be allocated a number. Staff involved in analysis will have
                access to participants' numbers only. All data from test sessions will be recorded against the
                participant's ID number and their name will never be used in any report, correspondence or publication.
            </p>
